# Question Dump / Journal App

Online collection of questions and user stories. Space for people to put their thoughts online.
Not necessarily a social media site as I don't have a plan to implement a friend list at this time
or any way to connect between users. This is more for the more solitary person. Someone who would
rather sit on their computer and ask just write. Or maybe ask a question, and have someone relate.
Gives me something to code while I look for a job and firebase seems pretty cool.

Application basic goals

ANDROID APP IS THE GOAL

allow users without accounts to anonymously post questions/vent to board
space but let them know they are not able to delete or alter them once posted

allow users with accounts to ask questions/vent to board anonymously

have only users with accounts answer questions/reply to vents

track how many questions users answer and ask to gain credibility

only users with accounts may remove their questions or alter their questions/journal entries

connect to Google Firebase for backend and authentication

## stretch

connect to facebook for sign-in as facebook App

allow anonymous facebook sign in when asking questions

allow posting questions to facebook

allow posting answer milestones to facebook

add advertising


## current working point
layouts for register and login are made need to decide whether to implement back buttons or allow user to just press back on the phone

layout for profile made

layout for home view of post stream made and ""connected to"" the stream of posts (needs to be tested but need to test auth first)

layout for single post made (has delete button)
