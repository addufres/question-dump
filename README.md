# Question Dump / Journal App

Online collection of questions and user stories. Space for people to put their thoughts online.
Not necessarily a social media site as I don't have a plan to implement a friend list at this time
or any way to connect between users. This is more for the more solitary person. Someone who would
rather sit on their computer and ask just write. Or maybe ask a question, and have someone relate.
Gives me something to code while I look for a job and firebase seems pretty cool.

Application basic goals

ANDROID APP IS THE GOAL

connect to Google Firebase for backend and authentication

register and login through Firebase

create user and make posts

show all posts to main page for all users

click one post for detailed view

allow user to update profile

allow user to delete posts they made

## stretch

connect to facebook for sign-in as facebook App

allow anonymous facebook sign in when making posts

allow posting posts to facebook

allow posting milestones to facebook

add advertising

track milestones for post making

## current views
layouts for register and login are made need to decide whether to implement back buttons or allow user to just press back on the phone

layout for profile made

layout for home view of post stream made and ""connected to"" the stream of posts (needs to be tested but need to test auth first)

layout for single post made (has delete button)

menu for logout and add post button made

basic logic for firebase connection for login and post crud


## Current logic point

register users works with firebase authentication
login is finicky

create posts works

## Current Backend

users and posts persist with authentication and p/c relationships


## Bugs and Nasties

      sizing on message feed is super funky
##### register needs to be sorted this is a priority
      login isn't finding known users now that register has broken obviously so fix that too
